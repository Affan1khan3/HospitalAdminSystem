When implementing the above SQL queries in your application, make sure to use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection, especially when dealing with data input by users. Hereâ€™s an example of how to use prepared statements with the MySQLi extension in PHP:

php

// Assuming $conn is the connection object and $id is the patient ID you're updating
$stmt = $conn->prepare("UPDATE patientregistration SET firstName=?, lastName=?, dob=?, gender=?, email=?, contactNumber=?, doctorID=? WHERE id=?");
$stmt->bind_param("sssssii", $firstName, $lastName, $dob, $gender, $email, $contactNumber, $doctorID, $id);
$stmt->execute();
$stmt->close();
